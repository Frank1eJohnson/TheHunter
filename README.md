# The Hunter by Project Avalon

## How to set up:

1. use GitHub Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/) - or any other git tool if
   you can handle - to clone the project to your computer.

2. Remember to create a __new project__ with __StarterContent__ and copy its
   Content/StarterContent__ to the __Content__ folder of this project!!!!!

3. Then, launch the __TheHunter.uproject__, right click any file in Content Browser
   and click __Connect to Source Control__. If this option does not exist then
   ignore me.

4. That's it. when you need to commit and push, preferably save all and use
   your git tool. REMEMBER IF THERE are FILES FROM __StarterContent__ STOP
   COMMITING AND CHECK!!!!!!! (Starter Content files should already be ignored.)

5. ignore 5 this is a test.

That's it for now!
